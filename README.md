# [WIP] PyTorch Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks to serve as an introduction to PyTorch.

This repository is a basically a clone of https://github.com/mila-udem/welcome_tutorials/tree/master/pytorch that I wrote a year ago, with modifications for PyTorch 1.0.

It contains

1. An Introduction to the Torch Tensor Library and examples of basic operations
2. Autograd
3. Utilities for implementing Neural Networks and Optimization Algorithms
4. Image classification example - MNIST & CIFAR-10
5. Neural Machine Translation with Sequence to Sequence models
6. Generative Adversarial Networks - MNIST
